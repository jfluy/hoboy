##Create sample climate data

```{r}

n_days = 365

ppt <- rnorm(n_days, mean = 320, sd = 75)
pet <- rnorm(n_days, mean = 900, sd = 200)
aet <- rnorm(n_days, mean = 2000, sd = 100)
tmax <- rnorm(n_days, mean = 10.5, sd = 3)
tmin <- rnorm(n_days, mean = 7.5, sd = 3)
date <- seq(as.Date("2018/1/1"), as.Date("2018/12/31"), "days")

clim <- data.frame(ppt = ppt, pet = pet, aet = aet, tmax = tmax, tmin = tmin, date = date)

```

##Function Group 1: Summarize Data 
```{r}

source("R/calc_mean_summer_val.R")
calc_mean_summer_val(clim, clim$tmin)

## Find which days of the year have the most extreme climate values
## This only works if the the date column is called "date"!

source("R/find_extreme_dates.R")
find_extreme_dates(clim, min_xtreme = TRUE)

```

##Function Group 2A: Heat Stress Index 

```{r}

# Let's pretend there is a species that has a heat stress index of:
# Under 7 degrees = 0
# 7-9 degrees = 1
# 9-11 degrees = 2
# Over 11 degrees = 3

source("R/calc_HI.R")

poopoo <- calc_HI(clim, 7, 9, 11)

## Function that calculates the cost of drought
# Calculate drought costs

source("R/calc_drought_risk.R")
calc_drought_risk(clim, clim$aet, clim$pet, 1500)
# (data, aet, pet, drought_threshold, cost per drought day)

```

1. Pollution (polluted v. non-polluted)
2. Location 1, 2, 3
3. Veg communities A, B, C
Value: Production (money)


Create sample array data
```{r}

location_num <- 5
veg_num <- 3
pollution <- 2

drought_thresh = array(dim=c(location_num,veg_num, pollution))

for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in 1:3) {
    for (k in 1:2) {
      value = runif(min=500,max=2000,n=1)
    drought_thresh[i,j,k]=value
    }
  }
}


dimnames(drought_thresh) = list(c("USA","Switzerland","Maldives","Uruguay","Botswana"), 
                      c("Riparian Woodland","Coastal Sage Scrub","Deciduous Forest"),
                      c("Polluted","Non-Polluted"))

drought_thresh


drought_thresh2 = array(dim=c(location_num,veg_num, pollution))                  
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in 1:3) {
    for (k in 1:2) {
      value = calc_drought_cost(clim, clim$aet, clim$pet, drought_thresh[i,j,k], 50)
    drought_thresh2[i,j,k]=value
    }
  }
}

dimnames(drought_thresh2) = list(c("USA","Switzerland","Maldives","Uruguay","Botswana"), 
                      c("Riparian Woodland","Coastal Sage Scrub","Deciduous Forest"),
                      c("Polluted","Non-Polluted"))

drought_thresh2


```

```{r}

# Each place has a different threshold that constitutes a drought 
# Each combination of dimensions has its own unique drought threshold, so if you want to test everything at once then you can just use a function to determine the number of drought days per location. Then multiply the cost per drought day.
# populate with values (we are just guessing, ideally this is where measuring would occur)

# add useful names
